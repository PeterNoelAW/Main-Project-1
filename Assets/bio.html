        <p> There's no doubt in mind that I connect well with people. I smile often, usually the first to say hello to strangers and never mind lending a helping hand. Aside of all this, Im not a people's person. I love being to myself, taking time to let my brain run and over think everything, allowing myself to have this chance to teach myself how to understand people rather than going off of the present knowledge. Yes I know, itâ€™s a lot to put you before I even tell you my name but I wanted to get the complicated things out of the way first. To really learn more about me, click on my bio to really make learn something interesting. My name is Peter Noel. Born in Brooklyn, NY, lived in Brooklyn my whole life. I lived what I thought was the average life, went to Public School 221, Intermediate School 284, then graduated from Harry Van Arsdale High School. I worked multiple jobs such Score Educational Center ( tutor), Marshalls ( employee ),  Century 21( stock boy ), and finally Local #3 IBEW Electricians Union. My schooling also continued as I went to Empire State College, The SAE for Audio Engineering and a few courses at City Tech for Web Development. It sounds like my schooling and work is all over the place but the truth is, its all with purpose. There was something to learn from everything that is preparing for the biggest transition of my life.
